# Containers

Containers pour a collection of widgets (and possibly child containers) into
specific structures you like.

The three commonly-used containers are: 
- LinearLayout (the box model)
- RelativeLayout (a rule-based model)
- TableLayout (the grid model), along with ScrollView , a container designed to assist with implementing scrolling containers.
